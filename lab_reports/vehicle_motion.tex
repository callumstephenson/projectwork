    \section{Introduction}
    The aim of this report is to determine which techniques for analysing vehicle motion are most accurate, as well as 
    understanding how they are able to track a specific quantity about the vehicle. 
    
    Within this report, a model 1:18 488 GTB equipped with sensors will be used in order to investigate the performance of
    different sensors on the car. Being able to track the motion of a vehicle accurately is useful when trying to determine path,
    or to change certain values within the engine to increase effiency or maintain a set speed. One aspect to accuracy is the calibration of
    a measurement device between digital and real world steps. This is done on the model vehicle within this experiment similarly to
    how one might calibrate e-steps on a 3D printing machine by counting the movement in the axis comparative to rotation in the stepper motor.
